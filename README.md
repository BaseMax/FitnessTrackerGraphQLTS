# FitnessTrackerGraphQLTS
This project is a fitness tracker app developed as a GraphQL-based webservice using TypeScript and NestJS. The app allows users to log their workouts, track their fitness progress, and set fitness goals. Users can create custom workout routines, record exercise details, and view their workout history to monitor their fitness journey effectively.
